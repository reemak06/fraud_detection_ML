Effectiveness Measurement (post-implementation):
- Before/After fraud loss (total $ and rate).
- Recall@K of alerts (how many frauds caught among top K alerts).
- False positive rate (to protect customer experience).
- Average time-to-detection; % stopped pre-settlement.
- A/B test (pilot group vs control): compare fraud rate, customer friction.
